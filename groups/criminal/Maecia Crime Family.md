# Summary
The **Maecia Crime Family** is one of numerous criminal organizations operating within the [[Lampris|Republic of Lampris]]. The Maecia Family operates primarily in the southeastern region of Lampris, with the city of [[Sidmouth]] acting as both their base of operations and their northernmost frontier. The Maecia are almost entirely Tabaxi and generally limit recruitment to other Tabaxi. 

Unlike many similar organizations in Lampris, the Maecia Family is generally involved in "legitimate" trade of food and supplies for the local population. They typically avoid involvement in ethically questionable forms of commerce such as humanoid trafficking or the drug trade. Although this demonstrates a higher level of integrity and honor compared to other enterprises, it does mean that the Maecia Family has less discretionary capital than other organizations in their region. This has led to open conflict with other groups on several occasions.

# Organizational Structure
The Maecia Family, as their name suggests, is primarily operated by a single family group - the Maecia themselves. The organization is directed unilaterally by the family matriarch **Kedi Maecia**. Other members of the Maecia lineage typically occupy high-ranking positions within the organization.
