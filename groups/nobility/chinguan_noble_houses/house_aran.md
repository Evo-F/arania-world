# Summary
House Aran is a Ch'inguan Major House, holding the city of [[Dawngate]] as their seat. The current leader of House Aran is Lord Jayce Aran, the youngest lord of a Major House in all of Ch'ingua at only 26 years old. 

Prior to the ascension of House Dire during the [[4c1113_succession_crisis|Succession Crisis of 1113 4C]], House Aran was the "youngest" Major House in Ch'ingua, being elevated to this status just after the start of the [[nightfall|Nightfall]] by King Yarbus himself. House Aran was not the favored house for ascension at the time, so when they were elevated by the King, there was an immediate sense of resentment and dismissal from the other Major Houses. 

As a result of this dismissal, House Aran has developed a reputation as having something to prove. Their actions are typically motivated by a desire to aggrandize themselves or otherwise legitimize their position, and historically the Lords of House Aran have been a bit insecure even as individuals.
