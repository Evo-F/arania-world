# Notable Leaders
## Lord Michael Margrave I
Lord Michael Margrave I, also addressed as [[King Michael I]], was the Lord of House Margrave from 1109 4C until his death in 12 5C. Following the death of [[King Crallus III]], Michael was the first lord of a Major House to rally his banners in an attempt to seize the Ch'inguan throne. This rapid action led to House Margrave ultimately succeeding, and Michael was thus crowned King Michael I. 

His actions during the [[1113_succession_crisis]] earned him the derogatory title "The Usurper" from his most vocal detractors. 
## Lord Edric I
Lord Edric Margrave I, also addressed as [[King Edric I]], was the Lord of House Margrave from 155 5C until his death in 203 5C. By all accounts a patient and reasonable man, Edric's reign was a period of peace and prosperity across all of Ch'ingua. In the latter half of his reign, Edric was forced to address [[The Verny Conflict]], a period of civil unrest that ultimately led to the signing of the [[Barristow Accords]]. 
## Lord Edric II
Lord Edric Margrave II, also addressed as King Edric II, is the Lord of House Margrave and current King of Ch'ingua. Edric II ascended the throne following the death of his father, Edric I, in 203 5C. At the time, Edric II (also called "Edric the Younger") was only 17 years old, and some doubted his ability to lead the kingdom on account of his age. However, since he has ascended the throne, Edric has demonstrated considerable expertise in governance.
