# Summary
House Cole is a Ch'inguan Major House, holding the city of [[Fralia]] as their seat. The current leader of House Cole is [[Lord Albus Cole]], a man who has been variously described as "in league with dark powers beyond comprehension" and "insane."

House Cole was originally a Minor House, but rose to prominence during the [[1113_succession_crisis|Succession Crisis of 1113 4C]] thanks to their early alignment with [[House Margrave]], who would ultimately ascend the Ch'inguan throne. In recognition of their support, [[King Michael I]] elevated House Cole to the level of Major House, and granted them House Margrave's now-vacant seat of Fralia.
