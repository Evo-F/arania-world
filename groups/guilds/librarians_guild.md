title: The Librarians' Guild

# Summary
The Librarians' Guild is a group of scholars who are also trained in advanced melee combat. The members of this guild are sworn to protect [[The Grand Library]] of [[Carrin]] with their lives, and once advancing beyond the initiate stage, are bound to the library and forbidden from leaving. 

In addition to protecting the library, the guild members are also the primary scholars and advisors at the library itself, and are committed to serving those who come seeking knowledge in good faith. If it becomes clear that someone is wishing to use the library for evil, the guildsmen are empowered to confront them and escort them from the library - by force if necessary.

# Hierarchy
The Librarians' Guild consists of four stages of membership: Initiate, Acolyte, Guildsman, and Elder Guildsman. 

## Initiate
An Initiate is in the earliest stage of guild membership, and spends the majority of their days following a set curriculum of study and combat training. Most of this training is very general, and intended to provide the initiate with a strong foundation to continue learning as they advance. 

The guild does not accept initiates below the age of 16, and prospective initiates must pass an extensive exam before they may enter the guild. 

Initiates are the only class of guild members who are allowed to leave The Grand Library, though they must receive permission from their Acolyte before doing so. 

New guild members must remain Initiates for a minimum of three years before they can even be considered for promotion to Acolyte. In order to be promoted, an Initiate must demonstrate their competency in the four major spheres of The Grand Library - history, practical sciences, philosophy, and arcana. The Initiate must also pass a basic melee combat examination. 

## Acolyte
An Acolyte is in the second stage of guild membership, having successfully matriculated from the level of initiate by passing their final examinations in both scholarship and combat. As an Acolyte, a guild member is officially bound to The Grand Library, and may not leave. This stage is also where guild members must take the oath to protect the library and serve those who come seeking wisdom. Exceptional Acolytes may also be assigned a cohort of one or several Initiates to guide and mentor through their journey - this is considered an honorable pursuit, and an Initiate who shows strong progress will reflect well upon their Acolyte mentor.

There is no minimum amount of time that one must remain an Acolyte before progressing to the level of Guildsman - some remain Acolytes for their entire lives, usually by choice. In order to progress from Acolyte to Guildsman, a guild member must select a specialty in both scholarship and combat, and demonstrate an advanced proficiency in their chosen specialties. In combat, these specialties are swordsmanship, blunt weaponry, flail-and-chain, knives and daggers, and martial arts. 

Upon reaching Acolyte status, guild members are stripped of their surname and must renounce all titles, claims, and holdings thereof. 

Upon promotion to Guildsman, the guild member will receive a unique honorific title based on their chosen specialty:
- History - Historian
- Practical Sciences - Craftsman
- Philosophy - Orator
- Arcana - Magus

## Guildsman
Guildsmen are assigned to work primarily in the wing corresponding to their specialty. Guildsmen are only allowed to leave their assigned wing under the following circumstances:
- A guild member from another wing has gone missing. 
- The Grand Library is under attack or otherwise in need of protection.
- The Guildsman is ordered by the Guildmaster to do so.

Unlike Initiates and Acolytes, Guildsmen are no longer required to attend classes or training sessions, but are expected to maintain proficiency in their areas of expertise. Guildsmen are chiefly responsible for the training of Initiates and Acolytes in their subject fields, and subsequently for determining when a particular Initiate or Acolyte has demonstrated competency in that field. 

In addition to training lower guild members, Guildsmen are the primary scholarly resources within their department, and are expected to take the lead in assisting library patrons and guests however possible. 

A guild member must serve as a Guildsman for a minimum of 20 years, and be above the age of 60, before they may be promoted to Elder Guildsman.

## Elder Guildsman
The duties of an Elder Guildsman do not differ much from those of a normal Guildsman. On account of their (usually) advanced age and declining health, Elder Guildsmen are typically granted more administrative responsibilities such as cataloguing works, managing the archives, and responding to letters. Although on paper they still have a duty to protect The Grand Library with their lives, it is unlikely this would be enforced except in the most dire circumstances. It is generally accepted that most Elder Guildsmen would not make for effective guardians of the library anyway. 

## Guildmaster
The role of Guildmaster is bestowed upon the Elder Guildsman who has been a member of the guild for the longest period of time. The Guildmaster is responsible for guiding the actions of the guild and overseeing The Grand Library as an institution. 

The Guildmaster is the only guild member above the level of Initiate who has the privilege of leaving The Grand Library - however, this privilege is conditional on the approval of a 2/3 majority of the other Elder Guildsmen. This provision was added to the guild code following the end of the Nightfall, in order to ensure that the guild could not be fully exterminated.
	The thinking was that if The Grand Library were to come under serious attack, to the point where the guild itself was threatened, the Guildmaster would be summarily dismissed by the Elder Guildsmen and go into hiding elsewhere, while the remaining guild members remained behind to defend the library.

The Guildmaster has the authority to strip any guild member of their status at any time, for any reason. Once someone has been removed from The Librarians' Guild in this fashion, they may never re-enter it, even as an Initiate. They are also banned from accessing The Grand Archives for all time. 

# Itinerant Scholars
As an alternative to becoming a full Guildsman, an Acolyte may instead declare a willingness to become an Itinerant Scholar, in service to a noble house or a town. For this, the Acolyte must demonstrate a proficiency in all four subject areas of The Grand Library, though not to the same extent as a full Guildsman. The Acolyte may then be commissioned by the Guildmaster and granted an assignment elsewhere in the realm. 

Itinerant Scholars are still expected to protect The Grand Library using their skills in combat, and can be summoned back to the library in the event of attack. Otherwise, they serve at the pleasure of their assigned house or town, though they can be recalled by the Guildmaster. 

# Trivia
- The Librarians' Guild has only ever been mobilized to protect The Grand Library four times in its history, one of which was during the [[Nightfall]]. 
- When the library was sacked during the Nightfall, all members of the guild at that time were executed - for the duration of the Nightfall, the guild was effectively extinct. 
- The Librarians' Guild does not give any guest of the library any special treatment; in fact, they are expressly forbidden from demonstrating any positive or negative favor towards an individual or a group. In this way, they are bound to always be impartial scholarly guides.
