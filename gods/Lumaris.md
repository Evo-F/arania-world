# Description
Lumaris is the goddess of light and dark, and is considered the patron of duality and balance. Although she is primarily associated with light and darkness, Lumaris traditionally has dominion over any circumstance where balance is concerned. 

Lumaris will garner favor on those who offer her burnt food offerings or libations, but prefers that her followers invoke her name in their actions or pray directly to her for guidance and worship. Lumaris has high expectations of not just her followers, but mortals in general - despite this, she is respectful and understanding of human effort and the limitations thereof. 

# Cult
Lumaris will only bestow boons on her most devoted followers, who form an exclusive cult-like organization called the [[Order of the Half Moon]]. Those who leave the Order are considered apostates, and members of the Order are forbidden from all dealings with them. Lumaris will never bestow favor on an apostate no matter what, but in order to maintain balance, she will similarly never curse those who dishonor her.
