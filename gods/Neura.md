# Description
Neura is the goddess of science and knowledge, and governs the entire sphere of learning and education. In comparison to other gods, Neura requires very little from her followers - she is not partial to offerings, and only desires that she be invoked in relevant circumstances. 

Neura takes an indifferent, almost clinical outlook towards mortals, and it is sometimes said that she prefers to study the races of Arania rather than assist them. 

Neura very rarely bestows gifts on even her most ardent followers, but when she does, they typically consist of tomes of knowledge that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain. 

It is rumored that [[Librarians Guild|The Librarians' Guild]] maintains a direct conduit to Neura, which allows them to manage their extensive library and act as scholarly resources for all of Arania. This has neither been confirmed nor denied.
