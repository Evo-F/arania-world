# Description
Rhen is the goddess of water and the seas. In accordance with her dominion, Rhen primarily accepts offerings in the form of libations, and asks that her followers honor her through direct prayer. 

# Cult
Like the very waters she governs, Rhen is fickle and can be unpredictable in her temperament. Regardless, she bestows favor on her most devoted followers, the [[Cult of Rhen]]. Apostles of the Cult take a vow of poverty and do their best to live off the land itself, typically congregating in colonies near sources of fresh water. Members of the Cult are typically harmless unless provoked, in which case they will defend their home fiercely. 

# Opinions of Other Gods
The only other god that Rhen holds particular hostility for is [[Hailoch]], primarily on account of the natural conflict between their respective domains. Rhen is also generally irritated by Hailoch's jovial attitude and insistence on helping mortals. 

Rhen generally prefers to be left alone to her own devices, and has no particularly strong feelings on any of her fellow gods.
