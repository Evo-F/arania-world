# Description
Hermara is the goddess of fertility and holds sway over peace and gentleness among peoples. Hermara prefers that her followers pray directly to her, and accepts offerings of both drink and burnt food offerings. She is considered the partner of [[Trachan]], but the two are not wed. 

Hermara takes a more direct and caring role in her dealings with mortal, and often seeks to guide and nurture those who desire her help. This can sometimes get her into trouble with other gods, particularly Trachan, who wish to remain hands-off in their dealings with the mortal world.
