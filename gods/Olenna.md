# Description
Olenna is the goddess of chance and luck, and holds sway over that which cannot be controlled. In addition to drink, Olenna accepts monetary offerings from those who wish to curry favor with her. In particular, she expects believers to express gratitude and recognition to her when things go their way. 

# Cult
Olenna prefers to go with the flow and tends not to intervene directly unless absolutely necessary. Despite this, she does bestow exclusive favor on her most devoted followers, the [[League of the Coin]]. As part of their pact with Olenna, members of the League of the Coin are forbidden from gambling with non-members, as Olenna's favor would provide them with an unfair advantage. Those who align themselves with Olenna will find themselves with uncanny luck. 

# Opinions of Other Gods
Olenna's most notable quarrel is with [[Zenus]], as their spheres of influence are often at odds with one another. Zenus takes issue with the random and chaotic fates of travellers and foreigners at the hands of Olenna, while Olenna thinks that Zenus' protection of guestright is ridiculous, under the pretense that fairness can only be achieved through random chance. 

Olenna and [[Lumaris]] have a much tighter bond than one might expect, on account of the natural synergy between their planes (Olenna's luck and Lumaris' balance). Gamblers can often be heard praying to Olenna and Lumaris in tandem when they encounter a run of bad luck, in the hopes that the Goddess of Balance might intercede for them and grant a boon.
