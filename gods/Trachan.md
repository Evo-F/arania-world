# Description
Trachan (pronounced trah-kahn) is the god of the sky. He holds sway over not just the sky, but the winds and stars which move among it. Trachan is considered a just and fair god, and despite his typical disregard for mortals, he is generally considered the patron of worldly honor and justice.

Trachan does not ask for much from his believers - only the occasional offering of drink. He also desires that his name be invoked in manners concerning his areas of influence. For example, most legal proceedings in Ch'ingua and less-developed regions of Lampris will always begin with an invocation and offering to Trachan; otherwise, the proceeding is not considered legitimate. There have been numerous instances in Ch'ingua of matters before the high court being thrown out due to improper invocations of Trachan.

In recognition of particularly favorable actions, Trachan prefers to bestow gifts of the spiritual variety, bolstering the natural charisma and integrity of his most trusted followers.
