# Description
Zenus is the god of the home and hospitality, and is the patron of guestright and warm fire. Zenus does not accept offerings, instead preferring that his followers perform acts of service in his name. Zenus always shows favor on those who protect and preserve guestright, and honor those who find themselves in strange or foreign lands. 

Conversely, Zenus has very little patience and tolerance for those who would violate guestright or otherwise refuse to honor strangers and travelers. He is known to inflict curses on those who would turn away travelers.
