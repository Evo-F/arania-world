# Description
Barro is the god of war and violence, and his dominion is all that is motivated or moved by aggression. Barro is by far the most demanding of the major gods, as he is only pacified by direct human sacrifice or the shedding of blood in his name. He will not respond to prayers or offerings of any other kind, and bestows favor only on those who wound and kill in his name. 

Despite his high expectations, Barro typically does not concern himself with cursing or otherwise hindering those who do not follow him or do as he desires. Barro is primarily amused by the dealings of mortals, and finds it quaint that they believe they have power over their own affairs. 

# Cult
The most devout followers of Barro make up a cult known as the [[Red Star]]. Those in the Red Star consider themselves personally responsible for appeasing Barro and keeping him from reaping the people of Arania directly. They do this by providing him with routine sacrifices. Members of the Red Star are some of the most ruthless and terrifying warriors in all of Arania, seemingly indifferent to their own injuries and pain and in some cases drawing power from them. It is believed by some that Barro himself heals their wounds and stops their pain in exchange for continued service. 

Those who leave the Red Star are ruthlessly hunted down by other members and captured alive for a unique ritualistic sacrifice. It is said that leaving the Red Star is to call down the wrath of Barro himself, and as such, apostates are always the primary target of Red Star cultists.
