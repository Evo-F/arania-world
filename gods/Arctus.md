# Description
Arctus is the god of magic and all other arcane arts, and holds power over both the arts themselves and those who practice them. Arctus is considered one of the more demanding gods, insisting on the burning of incense and the knowing and willful sacrifice of gems or precious metals ground into dust. In addition to offerings, he prefers that his followers pray to him directly.

Arctus is well aware of the power he holds over mortals, and the control that he has over their day-to-day affairs. However, he also recognizes that mortals do have their uses, and is willing to deal with them to serve his own purposes. Despite his attitude of arrogance, Arctus is not considered an evil or nefarious god - he is considered pragmatic and crafty, and is honored in that way.
