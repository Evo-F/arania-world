# Description
Hailoch is the god of smithing and weaponry, and the patron of hot fire. He is contrasted with [[Zenus]] as he primarily holds sway over the *power* of fire, and its ability to create and destroy under extreme circumstances. 

In keeping with his sphere of influence, Hailoch prefers the burning of incense over other offerings, and asks that his followers perform acts of service in his name in order to honor him. Hailoch is considered jovial and sanguine, and is typically benevolent towards mortals who desire his assistance. 

Boons of Hailoch typically come in the form of enhanced weaponry and armor. 

# Opinions of Other Gods
Hailoch does not quarrel with any other gods in particular, on account of his jolly temperament. However, his perpetual optimism and willingness to help mortals does get on the nerves of other more indifferent gods, particularly [[Trachan]] and [[Rhen]]. 

Rhen specifically does take umbridge with Hailoch on account of the natural enmity between their domains (fire vs. water). However, this feeling is not reciprocated, and Hailoch is more than happy to treat Rhen as a friend and colleague even when Rhen treats him with contempt.

Hailoch gets along particularly well with [[Barro]] and [[Olenna]], though Hailoch is decidedly the least chaotic of the three. Still, his domain of fire and the destructive powers thereof make him a natural partner for the gods of War and Chance.
