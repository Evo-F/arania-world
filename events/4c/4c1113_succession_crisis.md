# Summary
The Succession Crisis of 1113 4C was a period of brief civil unrest in the nation of [[chingua|Ch'ingua]] following the death of King Crallus III "The Brief" of [[house_ossetius|House Ossetius]]. This period concluded with [[house_margrave|House Margrave]] declaring themselves as the Ch'inguan Royal House uncontested and the crowning of King Michael I "The Usurper." 
# Origins
In early 1113 4C, Crallus III was crowned as king of Ch'ingua following the death of his father, King Perseus II. The only child of Perseus, Crallus was prepared from a young age to ascend the throne upon his father's death or abdication, and many throughout Ch'ingua were optimistic as the young prince had some promise in martial leadership and knowledge of economics.

However, Crallus had a weak and sickly constitution, and was prone to coughing fits and fainting even on his best days. He seldom left Stonehall Castle, an oddity for heirs apparent who were expected to tour the kingdom regularly. 

Upon his ascension to the throne, Crallus did not present himself in public for nine weeks. Though at first believed to be in mourning, rumors quickly spread that the new king had taken ill, his already fragile constitution weakened by the sudden passing of his father. Crallus made a total of four public appearances between his coronation day and his death three months later.

When Crallus died on 11 October 1113 4C, the stewards of the Royal House searched in vain for any eligible member of House Ossetius to be crowned in his place. However, when no eligible members were found, House Ossetius was declared extinct according to Ch'inguan law and custom. For the first time in nearly a millennium, Ch'ingua did not have a Royal House.
# Open Warfare
Within days of Crallus' death, all five Major Houses of Ch'ingua had rallied their armies and begun  consolidating power. Nearly all of the Minor Houses had aligned themselves with various Major Houses in the hopes of elevating their own status following the war that many saw as inevitable. 

There is some debate as to what the Succession Crisis truly constitutes in Ch'inguan history. Some scholars classify it as merely a period of pronounced civil unrest, while others view it as a true Ch'inguan civil war. 
# Notable Battles
- Battle of [[Kolir]] - 15 October 1113 4C
	- The first major skirmish of the Crisis, the Battle of Kolir saw the forces of House Kolir and House Mynham successfully repel an attempted siege by the forces of House Aran. 
- Battle of [[Fralia]] - 9 November 1113 4C
	- Considered the "turning point" of the Crisis, the Battle of Fralia saw the city captured by [[house_margrave|House Margrave]] and [[house_cole|House Cole]] from a band of Ossetius loyalists. 
	- In recognition of their service, House Cole was elevated to a Major House and granted Fralia as their seat following the ascension of King Michael I.
