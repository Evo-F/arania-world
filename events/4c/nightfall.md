title: The Nightfall
---
The Nightfall, or simply "Nightfall", was a period of time in the late 4th Cycle characterized by suppression of scholarly pursuits and work across Arania. The Nightfall began in the year 902 4C following a decree by King Yarbus Ossetius of Ch'ingua, and ended in the year 1114 4C with the revocation of that decree by King Michael Margrave of Ch'ingua. This was effectively Arania's dark age, marked by a resurgence in religious fervor and outright persecution of anyone associated with scholarly work. 

With the conclusion of the Nightfall, The Timekeepers declare the conclusion of the 4th Cycle itself.
