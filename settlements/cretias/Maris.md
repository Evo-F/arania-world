# Summary
Maris is a large town located northeast of [[Carrin]]. It is known for its primary export, the renowned Marisi Rum. Maris shares the semi-tropical climate of its larger neighbor, and as a result has a fairly unique agricultural makeup which includes sugarcane. 

Marisi Rum is undeniably the most valuable beverage in Arania, and some would suggest it is the most valuable liquid by volume. A 750mL bottle of the liquor can sell for thousands of gold pieces depending on its age. 

# Marisi Rum
Although otherwise unremarkable, Maris is known throughout Arania thanks to its primary export: Marisi Rum. This unique liquor is prized on account of both its rarity and sophisticated flavor. 

The rum is produced at the Encan Distillery, a family-owned distillery that has records of operation dating back to the 3rd Cycle. The Encan family closely guards the recipe for Marisi Rum, and it is even rumored that the recipe itself is laden with ancient magic, such that it can only ever be known by members of the Encan family. 

The Encans produce two batches of the liquor each year - the "Spring Batch" is typically produced in April while the "Autumn Batch" is produced in late September. The most discerning drinkers have observed that Spring Batch rum typically has a "lighter, almost fruity flavor", while Autumn Batch rum is typically "more robust, with herbal notes." Despite their flavor differences, there is typically no difference in value for Spring Batch rum vs. Autumn Batch rum. 

Marisi Rum is distilled in incredibly small batches, with the total yield varying from year to year but hardly ever exceeding 200 liters in total per batch. This makes bottles of the liquor incredibly valuable, leaving the drink to be found only in the highest tier of taverns, clubs, and aristocratic liquor vaults.
