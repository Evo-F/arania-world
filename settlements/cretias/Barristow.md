# Summary
Barristow is the capital of Cretias and one of the largest cities in the entirety of Arania. Barristow is defined by its most pronounced feature, the Steward's Hall, which is a massive citadel built into a nearby hillside. The city was originally founded on the hill, but has since sprawled out significantly from it.
