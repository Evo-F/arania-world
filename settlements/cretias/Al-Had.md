# Summary
Al-Had is a city located in the northern forest of Arania, within the borders of Cretias. Because of its northern and relatively remote location, Al-Had is heavily reliant on land trade with larger cities in Cretias; however, the government of Al-Had puts a significant emphasis on self-sufficiency, and it is generally accepted that the city would be able to survive indefinitely if trade were to be interrupted.
