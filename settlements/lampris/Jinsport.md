Jinsport is a port city located on the island of Hailoch in the [[lampris|Republic of Lampris]]. It is located at the southern tip of the island, at the southern base of Mount Dray. 

The city functions primarily as a trading post and waystation, allowing ships on long journeys around the southeastern coast of Arania to resupply their crews and anchor in a calm and well-protected harbor. 

Jinsport sees regular traffic from the nearby Ch'inguan city of [[Kolir]], as well as irregular traffic from other ports in Ch'ingua. Because of its location, there is effectively no Lamprian sovereign presence in the city; it is largely self-governing and is one of the only cities on the continent universally recognized as a freeport. 

# History
## 1st Cycle
Jinsport was established at some point in the mid-1st Cycle by [[jin|Jin of the East]], an explorer who most consider the first to set foot on the island of Hailoch. Jinsport was established first as a minor outpost for expeditions to the mainland of Arania led by Jin and her company; over time, the outpost grew into a city and freeport. Later, Jinsport was declared the capital of a new state called Jin's Confederacy, which claimed dominion over the island of Hailoch and several smaller islands off of Hailoch's coast.

## 2nd Cycle
The majority of Jinsport's growth occurred during the 2nd Cycle, and the city quickly found itself the hub of sea trade for the entire southeast of Arania. With the formation of the kingdom of [[chingua|Ch'ingua]] and the strengthening of several other coastal cities such as Kolir and [[Dawngate]], Jinsport continued to grow through trade and shrewd diplomacy with its neighbors. 

Although the capital of a major nation-state, Jinsport maintained no standing navy and a very modest standing garrison within the city itself. This was a deliberate policy established by Jin of the East prior to her death - if Jinsport, or any city for that matter, was to be considered a truly neutral place to do business, that city had to present itself neutrally to all parties. There is great debate amongst modern scholars regarding this aspect of Jin's political philosophy; nevertheless, the mandate of "True Neutrality" served Jinsport well.

Around the middle of the 2nd Cycle, a collective of scholars arrived in Jinsport with the express goal of establishing an academic institution unburdened by political affiliations and restrictions. These scholars obtained a sizeable plot of land to the north of Jinsport and established [[the_academy|The Academy]]. With the city's neutrality and economic engine supporting it, The Academy flourished and attracted scholars from across Arania. 

## 3rd Cycle
With the turn of the 3rd Cycle, Jinsport's status as a city of influence in the region began to decline. A larger and larger portion of sea trade was being directed through mainland ports such as Kolir and Dawngate, and although these cities had to contend with additional restrictions due to their position in Ch'ingua, the merchants of the southeast preferred the additional security guaranteed those cities by the Ch'inguan monarchy.

In order to avert a complete economic disaster, the leader of Jin's Confederacy made the decision to dissolve the state and instead join its holdings with the newly-formed Republic of Lampris. Although the city changed hands, its distance from the Lamprian heartland meant that it largely retained its status as a self-governing freeport, while benefitting from the security and stability of the Republic. This led to a modest resurgence in trade and a short-term aversion of collapse.
