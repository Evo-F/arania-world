Lakeshore is a small city located on the eastern shore of Lake Orgnar in central Lampris, roughly two days' journey from the border with Ch'ingua. 

Because of its picturesque landscape and generally favorable climate, Lakeshore's economy is based largely around tourism and [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_haven). Lakeshore is the regional capital of the Orgnar District. 
# Entering the City
Lakeshore primarily caters to the rich elite of Lampris, and as a result, people cannot simply walk into the town. The high walls of Lakeshore are manned and maintained by The Cerulean Guard, a private security service funded by the wealthiest benefactors of the town in order to protect their own interests. 

In order to gain access to the city the "proper" way, one must prove that they belong there. This is done either by presenting a Citizenship Token (issued to all long-term residents of Lakeshore as a matter of course), or by paying an entry fee.
