Drayside is a coastal hamlet located at the western base of Mount Dray, on the island of Hailoch in [[Lampris]]. It is one of the few population centers in Lampris that does not have a significant organized criminal presence; instead, citizens are largely self-sufficient and work together to ensure their own survival. Drayside is effectively a commune. 

Because of its seclusion, Drayside is a popular destination for those seeking to start over, or those trying to hide from somebody else.
