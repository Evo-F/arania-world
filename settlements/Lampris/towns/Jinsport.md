Jinsport is a port city located on the island of Hailoch in [[Lampris]]. It is located at the southern tip of the island, at the southern base of Mount Dray. 

The city functions primarily as a trading post and waystation, allowing ships on long journeys around the southeastern coast of Arania to resupply their crews and anchor in a calm and well-protected harbor. 

Jinsport sees regular traffic from the nearby Ch'inguan city of [[Kolir]], as well as irregular traffic from other ports in Ch'ingua. Because of its location, there is effectively no Lamprian sovereign presence in the city; it is largely self-governing and is one of the only cities on the continent universally recognized as a freeport.
