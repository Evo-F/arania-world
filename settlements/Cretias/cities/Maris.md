# Summary
Maris is a large town located northeast of [[Carrin]]. It is known for its primary export, the renowned Marisi Rum. Maris shares the semi-tropical climate of its larger neighbor, and as a result has a fairly unique agricultural makeup which includes sugarcane. 

Marisi Rum is considered the most valuable drink in all of Arania, and one of the most valuable liquids outright. The smallest measure of Marisi Rum can go for many times the price of fine wine in most bars.
