# Summary
Carrin is a city on the western coast of Arania, known for its consistent and semi-tropical climate and natural harbor. It is also the home of [[The Grand Library]] which is considered the preeminent house of wisdom and scholarship in all of Arania. 

Carrin's economy is mainly driven by trade and travel, as it is a major hub for sea routes ferrying both passengers and cargo. Because of its consistent flow of people in many directions, Carrin has become an extremely lucrative location for bars, taverns, inns, and various other ventures that cater primarily to travelers. However, Carrin's largely transient population has made it hard for the city to retain much of a stable "traditional" economy - in circumstances where travel is impacted, Carrin suffers more than most other cities, and takes longer to recover. 

# Geography and Wards
Carrin sits on a mostly flat piece of land, and is bounded on three sides (north, south, and east) by thick stone walls each punctuated by a single gate. The Eastern Gate is considered the main gate and is more heavily fortified and guarded. 

Carrin hosts a collection of *highways* which are extensively maintained by the civil government and represent high-traffic overland routes through and across the city. Aside from these highways, each ward is responsible for maintaining (or not) its own system of roads, paths, and alleyways. 

Carrin is separated into nine wards.

## Old Town
Old Town consists of the area immediately surrounding The Grand Library, and is the oldest part of the city. Prior to its expansion in the middle of the 3rd Cycle, the boundaries of Old Town represent the original boundaries of Carrin when it was little more than a coastal trading post and the home of the Librarians' Guild. 
## The Grand Library
Because of its significance in the city, The Grand Library constitutes its own ward. Strictly speaking The Librarians' Guild is able to elect their own alderman, but historically this has always been the Guildmaster. 
## Northgate
Northgate, as the name suggests, is the area nearest to Carrin's northern gate, and is one of the denser wards of the city. Northgate is primarily a working-class ward, and the majority of businesses in the area cater to travelers. 
## East Carrin
East Carrin is the newest section of Carrin, having been constructed in the middle of the 4th Cycle just prior to the Nightfall. East Carrin is lightly populated, instead primarily consisting of trading posts and stores which do business through the city's busy Eastern Gate. Carrin's main garrison can also be found in East Carrin. 
## Southways
Southways is the name given to the southern section of the city. Aside from its proximity to the Southern Gate, there is nothing particularly significant about Southways.

The Carrish guard detachment for this ward is known for attempting to extort money from travelers leaving the city through the Southern Gate. **It is strictly advised NOT to give any money to members of the Southways Guard**, lest it embolden their antics even further.
## The Docklands
The Docklands follows the line of Carrin's coastline and is largely populated by dock workers, fishermen, and sailors. This ward is largely working-class like Northgate, but surprisingly does not cater much to travelers at all. Most people transiting through Carrin via the sea will choose to spend their shore leave elsewhere.
## Buxton
Buxton is the second-oldest ward of Carrin after Old Town, and was constructed as a hybrid residential and industrial district to bridge the gap between Old Town and the coastline. Buxton houses nearly every warehouse in the city, and its name is itself an allusion to its purpose ("box-town"). 
## Fortune
Fortune is a prosperous upper-class neighborhood of Carrin, populated relatively sparsely with opulent villas and estates. 
## The Warren
The Warren is an incredibly dense slum situated just south of Fortune. Although The Warren is a recognized ward, and does elect an alderman to the city council (see below), it is considered to be lawless, almost anarchic. Its density makes the neighborhood a hotbed for crime and violence, and in certain parts of the neighborhood overhanging structures can block sunlight completely, effectively turning alleyways into tunnels. 

It is generally accepted that there is no good (or legal) reason to enter The Warren, and it should be avoided at all costs. 

The Warren is the only ward which does not have any major highways running *through* it. Instead, it is bounded on all sides by highways. 
> [!example] DM's Note
> The Warren draws heavy influence from the [Kowloon Walled City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City), a hyper-dense structure in Hong Kong which was demolished between 1993 and 1994. 
> While it stood, the KWC had the highest population density on the planet. It has yet to be beaten. 


# Politics
Each of Carrin's nine wards is represented by an alderman elected by the ward residents. The aldermen serve as a ruling council to jointly govern the city, with one alderman being elected as the mayor for a term of two years. A simple majority of aldermen is required to elect the mayor (five out of nine), and aldermen are permitted to vote for themselves. 

When it is time to vote for a mayor, the aldermen must make their decision within three days. If a decision is not reached in this time, the people of Carrin get to vote between the two aldermen who have consistently received the most votes in the council. All adult citizens of Carrin are able to vote in this circumstance.
