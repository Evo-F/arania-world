# Summary
Old Barris is a small town located west-southwest of [[Barristow]], and is considered the historical founding location of [[Cretias]]. Although the town was historically a major center of commerce and culture, it is now little more than a larger-than-average farming village.

Since [[The Verny Conflict]], Old Barris has experienced a significant amount of flight, as residents have taken opportunities to migrate to the larger cities of Barristow and [[Carrin]] in order to guarantee safety and continued employment.
