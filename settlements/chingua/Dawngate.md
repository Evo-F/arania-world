# Summary
Dawngate is a coastal city in [[chingua|Ch'ingua]] located in the northeast corner of the kingdom, just south of the border with Cretias. As befits its name, Dawngate is the easternmost point in Ch'ingua.

# Naval Tradition
Dawngate's defining characteristic is its strong naval tradition. Although geographically similar to its southerly neighbor [[Kolir]], the Dawnae have always felt drawn to the sea, and the city is home to several shipyards and drydocks which can construct ships at a surprisingly rapid pace. At Ch'ingua's height in the early 4th Cycle, almost every vessel in the Royal Navy was constructed in Dawngate. 

Dawngate maintains a modestly-sized navy capable of defending the city and its holdings. On a regional scale, Dawngate is a dominant naval power, although it would likely fare poorly in a confrontation with a nation-state such as Cretias.

Dawngate is also a hub for the construction and dispatch of civilian vessels, primarily trading ships and exploratory vessels. Many naval expeditions to the east originate in Dawngate not just on account of its location but also with respect to its strong naval tradition.
