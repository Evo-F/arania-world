# Summary
Kolir is a port city on the eastern coast of [[Ch'ingua]]. Kolir is one of the older cities of Ch'ingua, tracing its roots as far back as the early 2nd Cycle. 

Kolir is controlled by [[House Kolir]], a Ch'inguan royal house that has held fiefdom over the city since its founding. House Kolir is generally well-respected and liked by the city's citizens.
# Geography
Kolir is situated on a high promontory above a natural harbor on Ch'ingua's east coast. The land surrounding Kolir is hilly and rough, which has constrained much of the city's development and forced its citizens to expand the city vertically. 

Despite its unforgiving landscape, Kolir maintains a generally prosperous economy thanks to its natural harbor and strategic coastal location, enabling easy trade with other Ch'inguan settlements as well as its neighbor to the north, [[Cretias]]. 
# Layout
Kolir's dominating landmark is its seat of government, the Kolir Citadel. The Citadel is a massive stone tower partially carved out of the rocky promontory on which the city sits. It is believed to be one of the oldest structures in Ch'ingua still standing.

From the Citadel, tall stone walls encircle the city, representing its outermost borders. The walls are punctuated by five garrison towers at roughly equidistant intervals; each tower informally marks one of the city's five neighborhoods.

Because of its primarily vertical growth, much of Kolir resembles The Warren in [[Carrin]], devoid of natural light and almost totally enclosed by overhead development. The streets of Kolir are unmarked in most areas, more closely resembling alleys than real thoroughfares. The only major street through the city, and coincidentally the only area that receives consistent natural sunlight (apart from rooftops), is the Harborway. This is the main avenue connecting Kolir's single gate at its western edge with the harbor on the east side of the city. 
# Neighborhoods
Kolir is comprised of five neighborhoods of roughly equal size.
## Harborside
Harborside is the oldest neighborhood of Kolir, as it grew around the city's prosperous harbor. Harborside is a primarily coastal neighborhood on the eastern side of Kolir, and is largely comprised of seaside industries and residences for their laborers. The city's major thoroughfare, the Harboway, passes through Harborside and ends at the Kolir Shipyards. 
## Westgate
Westgate, as its name suggests, is the neighborhood immediately surrounding the city's western gate. Compared to other neighborhoods, Westgate holds closely to the Harborway, with its economy and the livelihood of its residents largely reliant on travelers and those passing through the western gate. Westgate features a number of taverns, inns, shops peddling travelers' wares, and other establishments catering to a more transient population.
## Mercantile District
The Mercantile District is where the majority of the city's bulk trade occurs, and as such is largely populated by warehouses, customs houses, and the occasional office. The neighborhood sits between the neighborhoods of Westgate and Harborside, acting as a sort of transfer point between ocean-going vessels and land couriers. The neighborhood stretches from Kolir's northern wall down to the Harborway. 
## Upper Vale
The Upper Vale is a smaller neighborhood on the southern side of Kolir. It is bounded in the north by the Harboway, in the south by Kolir's southern wall, in the west by Westgate, and in the east by the Lower Vale neighborhood. The Upper Vale is the city's primary residential neighborhood, and is primarily made up of multi-family houses and tenements. The Upper Vale is where the city's vertical development is most pronounced, with some residential structures reaching ten stories or even higher. Except on the very edges and on rooftops, the neighborhood receives virtually no natural light. 
## Lower Vale
The Lower Vale is the city's smallest neighborhood. It is bounded in the north by the Harborway, in the south by Kolir's southern wall, in the west by the Upper Vale neighborhood, and in the east by the Harborside neighborhood. The Lower Vale is considered a mixed-use neighborhood, with a relatively even distribution of housing and shops. The majority of the city's artisans and craftspeople reside in the Lower Vale, and it is not uncommon for many structures to have street-level businesses or shops with residences on the floors above. 
# Use of Artificial Light
Since much of Kolir does not receive consistent natural light, the city has developed fairly unique customs concerning the use of artificial light, typically in the form of lamps, torches, or mage lights. It is understood that a lit lamp above the doorway of a residence is an invitation for strangers to take refuge, while a lit lamp on either side of such a doorway indicates common courtesy without such an invitation. Unlit doorways are not to be approached, and in some areas avoided.

Through the use of various substances and magical techniques, artificial lights throughout Kolir are sometimes colored, usually to indicate which of the city's five neighborhoods you are currently in. This is a crucial wayfinding tool due to most streets being unmarked or sometimes unmapped. 

Although this usage of colored lights is not enforced, the pattern is generally understood as such:
- Blue - Harborside
- Green - Upper Vale
- Yellow/Gold - Mercantile District
- Red - Lower Vale
- White - Westgate
Accordingly, each neighborhood's associated garrison tower is sometimes referred to with the neighborhood's color (i.e. the tower over Harborside is called the "Blue Tower"). However, these nicknames are colloquial, and officially the towers' only designations are numbers (1 to 5, clockwise from the Citadel). 

# History of Unrest
Although generally a prosperous and well-regarded city (similar to [[Carrin]]), Kolir also has a storied history of localized civil unrest. Although House Kolir has always been in charge of the city, the city's administrator has been unseated by force no fewer than eight times throughout its history. Kolir frequently experiences workers' strikes, typically from various subsets of laborers employed in the city's prosperous harbor.

As befits a city of its stature, Kolir has also been subject to several repeated attempts at annexation and occupation, typically from other Ch'inguan noble houses. The most recent attempt occurred during the [[1113_succession_crisis|Succession Crisis of 1113 4C]] when [[House Aran]] attempted to seize the city in an early bid for power following the death of [[King Crallus III]]. Aided by House Mynham, House Kolir was able to repel the armies of House Aran and withstand a minor siege. 
# Recent History
At present, the city is occupied by [[House Cole]], assisted by auxiliary forces of the Cretian Military.
