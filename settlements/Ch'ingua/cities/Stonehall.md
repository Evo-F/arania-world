# Description
Stonehall is the capital city of the nation of Ch'ingua. It acquired its name because of its origins as a dwarven stronghold - the majority of the so-called "old city" is constructed out of stone and in some cases built directly into the surrounding landscape. The Stonehall Keep, which is the seat of the Ch'inguan royal family, extends deep into the earth - nobody is quite sure of the exact depth.
