Welcome to the Arania central wiki! Here, Evo has compiled all of the unearthed knowledge of the world of Arania and catalogued it for your convenience.

Currently, there are two campaigns running in Arania:
- [The Cartographers](https://arania-01.evofearnley.com), set in the 5th Cycle.
- [Arania #2](https://arania-02.evofearnley.com), set in the 3rd Cycle.

> [!info] In-Universe Date Notice

If you are participating in a campaign that takes place in the past relative to this date, take into account any timestamps or date ranges you see - certain information may or may not be relevant.
