title: Aranian Gods and Deities
---
# Summary
Across Arania, there are **ten** beings identified as supernatural or omnipotent who are variously worshipped as gods. 

Although customs and forms of worship vary across regions, it is generally accepted that all of these beings do exist and exert some measure of influence on the Material Plane.

# Forms of Worship
Aranian deities vary significantly in terms of how they are worshipped. Each deity has their own sphere of influence which can be considered an extension of the deity themselves; these spheres are themselves to be respected as one would respect the patron deity.

Typical forms of worship include:
- **Invocation** - Invoking the name or will of the deity prior to a relevant action. 
- **Acts of Service** - Providing charity or acting altruistically, whether explicitly in the deity's name or not.
- **Material Offerings** - Sacrificing some amount of material to the deity, such as food, drink, or precious items.
- **Prayer** - Directly soliciting and seeking communion with the deity.

Additionally, certain deities are worshipped by established cults or religious societies who may have specific practices for honoring their patron.

# Gods and Deities
The complete pantheon of Aranian gods and deities is as follows:

## [[Trachan]]
Trachan is the god of the sky and that which moves within it. Despite his typical disregard for mortals and the affairs of the Material Plane, he is typically associated with worldly honor and justice. 

## [[Hermara]]
Hermara is the goddess of fertility and is the patroness of peace and gentleness. Unlike most other gods, Hermara is not opposed to directly interceding in the Material Plane. She is traditionally identified as the consort of Trachan, but the two are not directly connected in any way.

## [[Barro]]
Barro is the god of war and has dominion over violence and bloodshed. Barro's will is typically carried out by apostles of the Red Star, a cult devoted to ritual combat and human sacrifice.

## [[Lumaris]]
Lumaris is the goddess of balance and is often referred to as the "Lady of Light and Dark." She is worshipped by a secretive organization known as the Order of the Half-Moon. In the interest of balance, Lumaris is hesitant to bestow boons or curses upon mortals, instead intervening directly only when absolutely necessary.

## [[Arctus]]
Arctus is the god of magic and the patron of its practitioners. He is traditionally depicted with a haughty and transactional attitude towards mortals, though never with nefarious intent. Arctus is generally considered pragmatic and crafty. 

## [[Hailoch]]
Hailoch is the god of smithing and weaponry, and is the one of the patrons of fire. He is understood to be the most outwardly benevolent of the gods, and is generally well-liked and respected even outside the faithful.

## [[Neura]]
Neura is the goddess of knowledge and is the patroness of all scholars. It is extremely rare for Neura to directly intervene in the Material Plane, as she prefers to take an indifferent outlook towards mortal affairs.

## [[Olenna]]
Olenna is the goddess of chance and luck, and is the patroness of gamblers, vagabonds, and charlatans. She is known to only ever intercede on behalf of her most devoted followers, and is otherwise inclined to allow things in the Material Plane to proceed on their own. Olenna is worshipped by a group known as the League of the Coin; little is known about this group aside from its primary constituents being criminals and gamblers. 

## [[Rhen]]
Rhen is the goddess of water and the seas, and serves as the patroness of sailors. She is worshipped by the appropriately-named Cult of Rhen, a pseudo-monastic order in which the faithful take vows of poverty and live off the land in isolated colonies (typically near fresh water). 

## [[Zenus]]
Zenus is the god of the home, the patron of guests and travelers, and one of the patrons of fire. Zenus is known to reward those who honor and protect the guestright, while conversely cursing and harrying those who would deny it.
