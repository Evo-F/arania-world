title: Kingdoms of Arania
---
Throughout Arania's long and eventful history, the continent has been divided amongst various kingdoms and nation-states who sought to govern their part of Arania in any number of ways.

# Current States
## [[chingua|Ch'ingua]]
Ch'ingua is a hereditary monarchy in the southern portion of Arania. The nation is directly governed by a monarch (usually a king) who is also the patriarch of the Royal House. The major cities of Ch'ingua are similarly governed by Major Houses who by tradition swear fealty to the Royal House. 

## [[cretias|Cretias]]
Cretias is a military dictatorship in the northern portion of Arania. The nation is led by a Steward who is typically a high-ranking general or other military leader. The modern nation of Cretias was previously two different states - the Eastern Union of Cretias and the Western Republic of Cretias. Early in the 5th Cycle, the Eastern Union of Cretias became the Cretian Protectorate, invaded and annexed the Western Republic, and the entire nation became known simply as Cretias.

## [[lampris|Republic of Lampris]]
The Republic of Lampris, or simply Lampris, is a republic holding dominion over the southwestern portion of Arania. Unlike its neighbors, Lampris is primarily administered by a representative body, resembling a congress or parliament. This body is comprised of representatives from across Lampris, each seeking to further the interests of their own constituents. Unfortunately, Lampris' central government is relatively weak, and most of the constituent regions of the nation are effectively self-governing. Lampris is considered by some to be a [failed state.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state)

# Former States
## Eastern Union of Cretias
The Eastern Union of Cretias was a democratic nation governing the northeastern portion of Arania. The nation was characterized by a strong democratic government, which over time enabled the growth of a militaristic and populist faction within. In 12 5C, following years of economic stagnation, a military coup dissolved the Eastern Union of Cretias and formed the Cretian Protectorate.
## Cretian Protectorate
The Cretian Protectorate was the successor state to the Eastern Union of Cretias, and existed for a period of approximately 9 years. Upon the successful invasion and annexation of the Western Republic of Cretias, the Cretian Protectorate dissolved and became the modern state of Cretias. 
## Western Republic of Cretias
The Western Republic of Cretias was a republic similar to the modern nation of Lampris, albeit with a comparatively stronger central government. The Western Republic of Cretias (sometimes called "West Cretias") governed the northwestern portion of Arania, and was considered a prosperous and progressive nation. Their lack of military expenditure made them almost completely defenseless when they were invaded by the Cretian Protectorate, and the Western Republic fell within weeks.
## Jin's Confederacy
Jin's Confederacy was a state established in the late 1st Cycle, lasting in some form through the 3rd Cycle when it voluntarily joined the Republic of Lampris. Jin's Confederacy was the first state established on the island of Hailoch, and is named after the state's first leader, Jin of the East. She also established the city of [[Jinsport]], which served as the capital of Jin's Confederacy and still exists. 

# Former Non-State Entities
## Free Cities of the Fell
The Free Cities of the Fell were a loose association of cities in the southwestern portion of what is now the Republic of Lampris. These cities were located primarily in and around the Fell Desert, and while some of these cities have managed to survive to the present day as part of Lampris (such as [[Southreach]] and [[Felltide]]), many others have since fallen into ruin. The Free Cities rose to prominence at the end of the 2nd Cycle, but with the climate of the Fell Desert and its surroundings becoming harsher, as well as the formation of the Republic of Lampris in the mid-3rd Cycle, the Free Cities as an association no longer existed by the turn of the 4th Cycle. 
## The Barristow Republic
The Barristow Republic was a nation-state based in the city of [[Barristow]] and its surrounding lands.
