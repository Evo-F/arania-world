Throughout this compendium, you will likely see several **Callouts** on various pages, such as the one at the top of this very page.

Callouts in use within this wiki are:

> [!example] Evo's Note
> These are notes or asides from Evo clarifying or elaborating on a particular topic. These callouts will typically be interspersed within a particular page. 

> [!abstract] Meta Information
> This banner signifies a large swath of information not directly pertaining to a campaign or the game world, but instead pertaining to anything outside of it. These callouts will typically appear at the top of a particular page, indicating that the rest of the page is "meta."

> [!info] Procedural Information
> This callout indicates procedural or boilerplate information such as copyright notices or usage instructions. You probably won't see this one very often.

> [!danger] Spoilers
> This callout indicates that the page you're viewing contains spoilers for future campaign sessions or narrative beats. These callouts are almost always temporary.
> These callouts will specify which campaign they are a spoiler for.

> [!warning] Tentative
> This callout indicates content that is subject to change as Evo is "not quite sure" about its inclusion.
