> [!abstract] Meta Information
> This page contains meta information that pertains to topics outside the game world. 

Throughout this compendium, you will likely see several **Callouts** on various pages, such as the one at the top of this very page.

While the Aranian Compendium is meant to resemble an in-universe resource for the Party, it is sometimes necessary to provide information to the players themselves rather than to the characters. In these cases, **Callouts** are used to signify that certain information is intended for the *player* rather than the *character.*

Callouts in use within this wiki are:

> [!example] DM's Note
> These are notes or asides from the DM clarifying or elaborating on a particular topic. These callouts will typically be interspersed within a particular page. 

> [!abstract] Meta Information
> This banner signifies a large swath of information not directly pertaining to the campaign or game world, but instead pertaining to anything outside of it. These callouts will typically appear at the top of a particular page, indicating that the rest of the page is "meta."

> [!info] Procedural Information
> This callout indicates procedural or boilerplate information such as copyright notices or usage instructions. You probably won't see this one very often.

> [!danger] Spoilers
> This callout indicates that the page you're viewing contains spoilers for future campaign sessions or narrative beats. These callouts are almost always temporary and will be present on material that I publish in advance of a given session. 
> Once we've actually gone through a particular session, I will remove the callout. 

> [!warning] Tentative
> This callout indicates content that is subject to change as the DM is "not quite sure" about its inclusion.
