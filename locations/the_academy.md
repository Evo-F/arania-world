title: The Academy

The Academy was an institution of higher learning established just outside the city of [[Jinsport]] in the year 764 1C. Unlike similar institutions such as [[the_grand_library|The Grand Library]] of [[Carrin]], The Academy was primarily an instructional institution, encouraging scholars and pupils from all of Arania to come and study in a neutral and free place. 

Those studying at The Academy did not receive a typical course of study as one might expect at other educational institutions. Instead, each pupil was assigned to a particular professor or faculty member depending on their desired area of scholarship. Pupils were encouraged to study independently however possible, receiving periodic direction or assignments from their faculty advisor. 

Because of this non-traditional approach to study, pupils did not "graduate" from The Academy in the traditional sense. Instead, their grasp of particular subject areas was continuously evaluated.

A pupil would receive a Proficiency Medallion made of silver upon achieving proficiency in a particular subject area. Although all Proficiency Medallions were of the same material, each bore a unique inscription according to the subject it represented.

For achieving true mastery of a subject, a pupil would receive a Mastery Medallion made of a unique material according to the subject. Some examples include:
- **Bronze**, for mastery of history.
- **Gold**, for mastery of business.
- **Meteoric Iron**, for mastery of smithing.
- **Copper**, for mastery of rhetoric.
- **Brass**, for mastery of music.
- **Steel**, for mastery of martial prowess. 
- **Adamantine**, for mastery of magic. The Mastery Medallion for magic was unique in that, in addition to its Adamantine base, it was inlaid with a particular gemstone crystal according to the pupil's chosen school of magic.
	- **Ruby** for abjuration.
	- **Amethyst** for conjuration.
	- **Emerald** for divination.
	- **Diamond** for enchantment.
	- **Citrine** for evocation.
	- **Topaz** for illusion.
	- **Onyx** for necromancy.
	- **Sapphire** for transmutation.

These medallions were recognized across Arania as tokens of a scholar's repute; a person bearing a medallion was automatically considered an authority on the topic at hand. 

Because The Academy lacked a formal course of study, it is unclear how long an individual might have worked to achieve a Mastery Medallion. The few surviving records on the matter indicate it typically took 2-4 years to achieve a Proficiency Medallion for a pupil who was reasonably competent in their subject area prior to arriving at The Academy. From these records, there is no indication of an approximate time to achieve a Mastery Medallion.
