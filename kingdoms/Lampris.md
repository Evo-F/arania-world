title: Republic of Lampris

# Summary
The Republic of Lampris is situated in the southwestern portion of the continent of Arania, and consists of a number of cities which are regionally self-governing but which also participate in a centralized representative body. 

The capital of Lampris is [[Mend]].

# Government
Lampris is separated into administrative districts, with each district being centralized on a particular city or large town. Each district sends several elected representatives to Mend in order to legislate for the entire nation. 

Although Lampris' central government was remarkably stable at the nation's founding, it has grown gradually weaker over the centuries, with the administrative districts and cities themselves gaining more and more power that had previously been delegated to the central government. Most cities in Lampris are now effectively self-governing, and the Republic itself is considered by some political scholars to be a failed state.
