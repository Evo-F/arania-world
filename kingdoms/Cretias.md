# Government
Officially, the government of Cretias is a military stewardship, with a governing Steward who has absolute power and direct control over the military, similar to a king. When the Steward dies, the highest-ranking generals of Cretias gather to designate a new Steward, who is typically one of their own. 

Each major city of Cretias is primarily controlled by a military governor, appointed by the Steward. This governor has de jur unchecked power, but historically, these governors take a hands-off approach and delegate the day-to-day operations of their cities to other bureaucrats. The Steward of Cretias is also the governor of Barristow.

# Creation of the Stewardship
From the foundation of Cretias through the very beginning of the 5th Cycle, Cretias was actually two separate nations - the Western Republic of Cretias and the Eastern Union of Cretias. Around 12 5C, there was a military coup in the Eastern Union of Cretias, resulting in the creation of the Cretian Protectorate. The new government of the protectorate did not take kindly to the existence of the Western Republic, and believed that the entirety of Cretias should be united under their rule. In 21 5C, the Cretian Protectorate launched a full-scale invasion of the Western Republic, reaching the capital city of Barristow in just under two weeks. The Cretian Protectorate officially annexed the Western Republic and declared the new nation of Cretias would henceforth be commanded by a military steward. 

See [[Foundation of Modern Cretias]] for additional information.

# The Conference Martial
The Conference Martial refers to the congregation of generals and military leaders in the event of the death of the Steward. When the Steward dies, the twelve highest-ranking and longest-serving generals along with the governors of Carrin, Verny, Maris, and Al-Had.

These generals are then locked within the main hall of The Steward's Hall, and must cast blind votes for the next Steward. Anyone can be elected, but in order to win, a person must receive two thirds of the votes cast. The generals are not released until a Steward is chosen.
