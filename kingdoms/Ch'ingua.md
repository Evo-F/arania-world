# Government
## Monarchy
Ch'ingua is a traditional monarchist state, ruled by a king or queen with absolute power. The role of king or queen is a hereditary office, whereby the eldest son of the ruling monarch inherits the throne upon the monarch's death. In cases where the ruling monarch has no sons, the eldest daughter inherits the throne. 

The Ch'inguan monarch's house of origin is referred to as the Ch'inguan Royal House - currently, this is [[House Margrave]]. The Ch'inguan Royal House holds direct sway over the Marches of Stonehall, as well as the city of [[Stonehall]] itself as the capital of Ch'ingua.
## Noble Houses
In addition to the royal family, Ch'ingua's government is largely controlled and managed by several noble houses, each one overseen by a Lord or Lady who holds direct control over a portion of the kingdom in the monarch's stead. Each noble house typically possesses their own armies and manages their own regional economy, though each is sworn to the Royal House as vassals. 

The Ch'inguan noble houses are divided between **major houses** and **minor houses**. 
### Major Houses
There are **five** major houses in Ch'ingua, each one holding sway over a major city and its surroundings. Currently, these are:
- [[House Dire]], holding the city of [[Tys]].
- [[House Kolir]], holding the city of [[Kolir]].
- [[House Aran]], holding the city of [[Dawngate]].
- [[House Cole]], holding the city of [[Fralia]].
- [[House Nistro]], holding the city of [[Katadin]].

As they have each sworn direct fealty to the Ch'inguan Royal House, the five major houses are rarely in direct opposition to one another. However, historically there has been very little love amongst the major houses, as each seeks to enrich themselves even at the expense of others. 

Major Houses are always elevated from an existing Minor House at the behest of the Royal House, typically to fill a vacancy. Most recently, this occurred with House Dire - following the [[1113_succession_crisis]] and the ascent of House Margrave to the throne of Ch'ingua, it was decreed that House Dire would take their place as the Major House of Tys. Previously, House Dire was a lesser-known house in the town of [[Luster]], but in recognition of their aid during the Succession Crisis, they were elevated to the status of Major House. 
### Minor Houses
In contrast to the major houses, there are a number of minor houses in Ch'ingua, varying in their size, strength, and relevance. Typically, a minor house holds sway over a town, and may swear fealty to a major house. However, the only real requirement to "become" a minor house is recognition from the Royal House.

The Royal House may recognize any family as a minor house at any time for any reason. The status of this family can only be revoked if (a) the family dies out entirely or (b) a majority of the Major Houses challenge the family's status. This has essentially never happened. 

The most relevant Minor Houses are:
- House Mynham, a longstanding vassal of House Kolir. 
- House Nistro
- House Redd
- House Ardent
- House Seabury

### Extinct Houses
A noble house becomes extinct when there are no eligible family members to receive the title of Lord or Lady of the house. This is an extremely rare occurrence, and has typically only happened in cases of serious political upheaval. 

The former Royal House, [[House Ossetius]], became extinct following the death of [[King Crallus III]], called "The Brief" on account of his notably short reign.
